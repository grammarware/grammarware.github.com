<H1>Software Language Processing Samples</H1>

<H3>Mission</H3>

We assume an educational attitude to gather software language
processing samples while exploring options for implementation
languages, idioms, and technologies to describe typical facets such as
evaluation, optimization, parsing or pretty printing.

<H3>FAQ</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>What's the layout of the samples collection?</B><DT>

<DD>The samples directory holds all the language processing
samples. Subdirectories of "samples" group different "implementations"
for the same "language under study" while having in mind certain
language processsing aspects (such as parsing, evaluation,
optimization, and pretty printing). There is also a "repository"
subdirectory with generic content that is reusable among the different
implementations. The implementations differ with regard to
implementation language, auxiliary technology, implementation method,
and leveraged concepts.</DD>

<P>

<DT><B>How to use the samples?</B></DT>

<DD>First, get an idea of the "layout of the samples collection"; see
above. Second, check out the subversion repository. Third, find a
"language" and an "implementation" of interest. Each implementation
should come with a README.txt file that explains the overall option
and gives explanations on how to run the sample. Each implementation
may make very specific assumptions; it may require some efforts meet
all assumptions. Whenever possible, an implementation comes with a
Makefile to demo it.</DD>

<P>

<DT><B>How to become a contributor?</B></DT>

<DD>Contributors are more than welcome. If you want to become a proper
contributor (with svn access), please submit a short request to the
slps-contributors mailing list or use SourceForge
functionality. Clearly, you need a SourceForge account to be a
contributor. This project uses the BSD license. If you merely want to
discuss issues with existing examples or just offer a quick fix or the
sketch of a new example, then please consider using one of the mailing
lists identified above.</DD>
